## **HTML**
<!-- [Syntaxsage-tech1]will write this section -->
# _HTML_ 🌐
---
## What is HTML 
HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)is the standard markup language used to create and structure contents on the website.

  ---

## Importance 
HTML is important because:
  >1.Every website on the internet is built using HTML.

  >2.It enables responsive web design for mobile and desktop.

  >3.It forms the foundation of front-end development.

  >4.It intergrates with mordern frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.

  >5.It is essential for web apps, e-commerce platforms, dashboards and more.

Without HTML, the web as we know it would not exist.
